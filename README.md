# GameDisplay

A simple HUD designed for Hypixel made using the ChatTriggers mod.

# Installation

Requires the 5.0 beta builds of ChatTriggers found here:
http://ct.kerbybit.com/download/

Place the downloaded file in .minecraft/mods. Then, use the command '/t import GameDisplay' to install GameDisplay. Please note that this can cause severe lag due to a glitch with the current versions of ChatTriggers. To fix this, use '/t load' each time you start up the game. Note that this may not be relevant for future releases of ChatTriggers.
